abstract = {The purpose of this study was to quantify microcirculation and microvasculature in breast lesions by pharmacokinetic analysis of Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI series. Strongly T1-weighted MR images were acquired in 18 patients with breast lesions using a saturation-recovery-TurboFLASH sequence. Concentration-time courses were determined for blood, pectoral muscle, and breast masses and subsequently analyzed by a two-compartment model to estimate plasma flow and the capillary transfer coefficient per unit of plasma volume (F/VP, KPS/VP) as well as fractional volumes of the plasma and interstitial space (fP, fI). Tissue parameters determined for pectoral muscle (fP = 0.04 +/- 0.01, fI = 0.09 +/- 0.01, F/VP = 2.4 +/- 1.3 min(-1), and KPS/VP = 1.2 +/- 0.5 min(-1)) and 10 histologically proven carcinomas (fP = 0.20 +/- 0.07, fI = 0.34 +/- 0.16, F/VP = 2.4 +/- 0.7 min(-1), and KPS/VP = 0.86 +/- 0.62 min(-1)) agreed reasonable well with literature data. Best separation between malignant and benign lesions was obtained by the ratio KPS/F (0.35 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.23 +/- 0.65). The functional imaging technique presented appears promising to quantitatively characterize tumor pathophysiology. Its impact on diagnosis and therapy management of breast tumors, however, has to be evaluated in larger patient studies.},

abstract = {We describe a standard set of quantity names and symbols related to the estimation of kinetic parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data, using diffusable agents such as gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA). These include a) the volume transfer constant K(trans) (min(-1)); b) the volume of extravascular extracellular space (EES) per unit volume of tissue v(e) (0 {\textless} v(e) {\textless} 1); and c) the flux rate constant between EES and plasma k(ep) (min(-1)). The rate constant is the ratio of the transfer constant to the EES (k(ep) = K(trans)/v(e)). Under flow-limited conditions K(trans) equals the blood plasma flow per unit volume of tissue; under permeability-limited conditions K(trans) equals the permeability surface area product per unit volume of tissue. We relate these quantities to previously published work from our groups; our future publications will refer to these standardized terms, and we propose that these be adopted as international standards.},
