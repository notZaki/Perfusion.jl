  abstract        = {Tracer kinetic methods employed for quantitative analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) share common roots with earlier tracer studies involving arterial-venous sampling and other dynamic imaging modalities. This article reviews the essential foundation concepts and principles in tracer kinetics that are relevant to DCE MRI, including the notions of impulse response and convolution, which are central to the analysis of DCE MRI data. We further examine the formulation and solutions of various compartmental models frequently used in the literature. Topics of recent interest in the processing of DCE MRI data, such as the account of water exchange and the use of reference tissue methods to obviate the measurement of an arterial input, are also discussed. Although the primary focus of this review is on the tracer models and methods for T(1) -weighted DCE MRI, some of these concepts and methods are also applicable for analysis of dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI data.},

  abstract = {A description of the vascular input function is needed to obtain tissue kinetic parameter estimates from dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) data. This paper describes a general modelling framework for defining compact functional forms to describe vascular input functions. By appropriately specifying the components of this model it is possible to generate models that are realistic, and that ensure that the tissue concentration curves can be analytically calculated. This means that the computations necessary to estimate parameters from measured data are relatively efficient, which is important if such methods are to become of use in clinical practice. Three models defined by four parameters, using exponential, gamma-variate and cosine descriptions of the bolus, are described and their properties investigated using simulations. The results indicate that if there is no plasma fraction, then the proposed models are indistinguishable. When a small plasma fraction is present the exponential model gives parameter estimates that are biassed by up to 50{\%}, while the other two models give very little bias; up to 10{\%} but less than 5{\%} in most cases. With a larger plasma fraction the exponential model is again biassed, the gamma-variate model has a small bias, but the cosine model has a very little bias and is indistinguishable from the model used to generate the data. The computational speed of the analytic approaches is compared with a fast-Fourier-transform-based numerical convolution approach. The analytic methods are nearly 10 times faster than the numerical methods for the isolated computation of the convolution, and around 4-5 times faster when used in an optimization routine to obtain parameter estimates. These results were obtained from five example data sets, one of which was examined in more detail to compare the estimates obtained using the different models, and with literature values.},

  abstract = {Rapid T(1)-weighted 3D spoiled gradient-echo (GRE) data sets were acquired in the abdomen of 23 cancer patients during a total of 113 separate visits to allow dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) analysis of tumor microvasculature. The arterial input function (AIF) was measured in each patient at each visit using an automated AIF extraction method following a standardized bolus administration of gadodiamide. The AIFs for each patient were combined to obtain a mean AIF that is representative for any individual. The functional form of this general AIF may be useful for studies in which AIF measurements are not possible. Improvements in the reproducibility of DCE-MRI model parameters (K(trans), v(e), and v(p)) were observed when this new, high-temporal-resolution population AIF was used, indicating the potential for increased sensitivity to therapy-induced change.},

  abstract = {Leakage of Gd-DTPA through a defective blood-brain barrier is measured quantitatively using dynamic MRI scanning, in which repeated scans are made after a bolus injection. Image registration artifacts are minimized; a dose of 0.1 mM/kg and an IR sequence enable enhancement to be measured quantitatively. The triexponential enhancement curve is fitted to a theoretical model based on compartmental analysis. The transfer constant, or permeability surface area product per unit volume of tissue (k), and leakage space per unit volume of tissue (v1) are measured. Estimates for a quickly enhancing multiple sclerosis lesion are k = 0.050 min-1, v1 = 21{\%}; for a slow one k = 0.013 min-1, v1 = 49{\%}. This implies permeability in the range 4-17 x 10(-6) cm s-1, in broad agreement with other physiological methods. The method is noninvasive and can be used to make serial measurements in patients and in experimental animal models. The time course of pathological aspects of diseases with blood-brain barrier breakdown, such as multiple sclerosis, tumors, and infections (e.g., HIV) can be studied, along with their response to therapy. The measurements are of physiological variables and are therefore independent of imaging equipment and field.},

@article{Yankeelov2009,
  abstract        = {Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) enables the quantitative assessment of tumor status and has found application in both pre-clinical tumor models as well as clinical oncology. DCE-MRI requires the serial acquisition of images before and after the injection of a paramagnetic contrast agent so that the variation of MR signal intensity with time can be recorded for each image voxel. As the agent enters into a tissue, it changes the MR signal intensity from the tissue to a degree that depends on the local concentration. After the agent is transported out of the tissue, the MR signal intensity returns to its' baseline value. By analyzing the associated signal intensity time course using an appropriate mathematical model, physiological parameters related to blood flow, vessel permeability, and tissue volume fractions can be extracted for each voxel or region of interest.In this review we first discuss the basic physics of this methodology, and then present technical aspects of how DCE-MRI data are acquired and analyzed. We also discuss appropriate models of contrast agent kinetics and how these can be used to elucidate tissue characteristics of importance in cancer biology. We conclude by briefly summarizing some future goals and demands of DCE-MRI.},
